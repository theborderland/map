    ðŸ‘‹ Hello! You're here because you want to place your camp somewhere at The Borderland! Placement is an important
    part of co-creating The Borderland and supports project planning, site logistics, and safety (mainly fire
    regulations).

        >It's also a collaborative process where we all work together to decide what camps, dreams, and experiences go
        where!</b
