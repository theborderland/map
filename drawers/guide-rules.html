        than that, make two (or more) polygons. and add a 5 meter separation (fire buffer)

<h3>Keep this in mind</h3>
<ol start="1">
    <li>
        Larger structures, kitchen tents, RVs and vans need 4 meters between them and anything else that is flammable.
        Ordinary camping tents can be placed anywhere inside your area.

    </li>
    <li>
        The fire roads must be kept clear at all times. Structures can be plazed in the plazas if there is enough space
        to move around, at least 5m

    <li>Remember that you are responsible for taking care of MOOP and cleaning up your area after the event. ♻️</li>
