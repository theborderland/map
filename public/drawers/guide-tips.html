<h2>What to consider when placing your camp</h2>
<p>There are many things to consider when placing your camp. Here are some examples:</p>
<ol start="1">
    <li>
        Placing more public dreams and activities outwards facing the road, and more private areas behind that can be
        nice.
    </li>
    <li>Are you a loud or silent/chill camp? Look at the soundmap to be guided where you might best fit in!</li>
    <li>
        Be guided by the suggested size, but feel free to make a more detailed plan and just use the field "Other stuff in m¬≤" if
        needed.
    </li>
    <li>
        Think about how closeness to water and toilets will affect you. If you are far away, bring a bike and trolleys.
    </li>
    <li>
        Do you want to be part of a plaza? ‚õ≥Ô∏èüòÉ Talk with other camps to align efforts! Planning a plaza together can
