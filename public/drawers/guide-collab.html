<h2>A Word on Collaboration</h2>
<p>
    ⚠️ Before you dive into the Placement process, it's important to understand that collaboration means there are no
    "first-come, first-served" rights to being placed on the map.

    <b
        >Nothing is final just because someone was there first. Rather, communication, negotiation, and co-creation are
        essential to Placement.</b

</p>
<p>
    💬Please start conversations with your fellow Borderlings about how to organize the neighborhood you'd like to be
    in. If your camp is open to more collaboration beyond friendly neighborhood relationships, consider curating a plaza
    with other camps and/or set up communication among the camps in the kvarter (your direct neighbors).
</p>
<p>
    There are discussion threads on Discord for each neighborhood-section under the
    <u>NEIGHBORHOODS 2024</u> category.

    🙅 If Discord isn't your thing, feel free to start conversations anywhere else, but definitely have someone in your
    camp check the Discord for an existing conversation about the neighborhood you'd like to be placed in, just so there
    are no surprises!
