        <h2>Why does the map already look so… alive?</h2>
        For the past six weeks 100+ Borderlings ran an open experiment called Pre-Placement.<br>
        We sketched the first version of:<br>

        ✅ Fire roads & new blue walking paths (for easier exploring)<br>
        ✅ Plazas & infrastructure (power nodes, toilets, sanctuary, etc.)<br>
        ✅ Early “vibe maps” for many neighborhoods—sound zones, chill zones, art clusters<br>
        <br>
        No territory is “reserved.” Everything on the current map is an invitation to collaborate, not a land-grab.
