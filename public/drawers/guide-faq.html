<sl-details summary="Can I only make one shape?">
    <sl-icon name="plus-square" slot="expand-icon"></sl-icon>
    <sl-icon name="dash-square" slot="collapse-icon"></sl-icon>
    No, you can make more shapes, if you need to. It can even be good to
    differentiate between your camp's living areas and your more "public facing" activities and dreams.

<sl-details summary="The fire roads (red) or walkways (blue)are blocking my plans! Can we change them?">
    <sl-icon name="plus-square" slot="expand-icon"></sl-icon>
    <sl-icon name="dash-square" slot="collapse-icon"></sl-icon>
    A lot of care and thought have gone into the road placement. The fire roads are required to be present.
    The walkways contribute to accessibility and connections.
    However, if you have a good reason to change them, please raise the topic on Discord or Talk and we can discuss it.

    <sl-icon name="plus-square" slot="expand-icon"></sl-icon>
    <sl-icon name="dash-square" slot="collapse-icon"></sl-icon>
    Yes, it's important for others to be able to communicate with you!
    Also, if your camp needs to be moved due to some unforeseen fire road adjustment, you might want to be notified...

<sl-details summary="How am I supposed to set up camp once arriving at The Borderland?">
    <sl-icon name="plus-square" slot="expand-icon"></sl-icon>
    <sl-icon name="dash-square" slot="collapse-icon"></sl-icon>
    You will have to carefully measure from the main fire roads, that will be marked beforehand by a group of people
    (Help needed!).
    Bring a measuring tape, and a string. Use the measure tool in the map to get the right distances.
    We will add some named "control points" both to the map and in reality, to help out when far away from fire roads.

<sl-details summary="I want to be involved in a plaza, how does it work?">
    <sl-icon name="plus-square" slot="expand-icon"></sl-icon>
    <sl-icon name="dash-square" slot="collapse-icon"></sl-icon>
    Try to bring a few camps together that have the same vision and level of engagement.
    Start a discussion on Discord expressing your interest in curating the plaza.
    This is the first year we are trying this so trial and error are likely to happen.
    There is no need to get permission and no option to claim the space, rather collaboration is encouraged around
    plazas.

    If you want to join a camp you can look for a camp with open spots. You can also ask on the Discord channel
    <a target="blank" href="https://discord.com/channels/932714386286575736/1073154926529753118">üòªcamp-matchmaking</a>
    , or have a look in the Facebook group

<sl-details summary="It's a very long way to the toilets from where I'm camping!">
    <sl-icon name="plus-square" slot="expand-icon"></sl-icon>
    <sl-icon name="dash-square" slot="collapse-icon"></sl-icon>
    Yes indeed it is! Place yourself closer to the toilets if you don't want to walk that far.
    Pooing in the bushes is a no-no and you will be eaten by the Narwhals if you do.
    You could also organize extra toilets in the field if that tickles your fancy.

<sl-details summary="What is The Borderland Shuffle?">
    <sl-icon name="plus-square" slot="expand-icon"></sl-icon>
    <sl-icon name="dash-square" slot="collapse-icon"></sl-icon>
    It's when we mess up the placement and have to move everything around.
    It's a lot of work and a lot of fun. The map is not the territory, people often confuse models of reality with
    reality itself you see (see Alfred Korzybski).

<sl-details summary="I will go and create my own camp, but with blackjack and hookers...">
    <sl-icon name="plus-square" slot="expand-icon"></sl-icon>
    <sl-icon name="dash-square" slot="collapse-icon"></sl-icon>
    Great! Make sure to pick a spot for it in the placement map. And if you seek members, spread the word in the above
    channels.

<sl-details summary="I'm so radical and self-reliant that I don't belong in a camp!">

    The concept is called freecamping and if you're taking up somewhat of a space that could be taken by other camps
    you should also use the placement process.
    Some freecampers still do cooking together and reserve a bigger area for freecampers,
    feel free to find other freecampers at the Discord channel
